### Advent of Code
**Advent of Code** is a fun coding challenge that happens every December. Think of it like an advent calendar, but instead of chocolate, you get puzzles! Every day from December 1st to 25th, a new puzzle is released.

**Each puzzle has two parts**:

- Solve Part 1, and you unlock Part 2, which usually builds on what you did in the first part.
- For each part you solve, you earn a star. That means you can earn 2 stars per day, adding up to 50 stars if you complete everything by Christmas.

Advent of Code is a great way to practice coding, challenge yourself, and even compete with others if you want to!
